This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Pong" using Python and the Turtle graphics module. The game features two paddles controlled by the player and a ball that bounces back and forth between the paddles. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game includes sound effects and keeps track of the score.
